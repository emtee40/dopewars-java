This program was originally developed in 2001 by code cowboys.
it has sat unchanged on sourceforge for many years, so i decided since i myself am now learning java, i should tweak it a bit and get some of the bugs out. i've since added a small bit of code to increase playability (randomize the druglist), and added more drugs and changed the locations to new york locations instead of australian locales.

it now resides on box.net, in my doveraudio folder. please enjoy, and i'll keep updating as my understanding of java increases.

thanks.
